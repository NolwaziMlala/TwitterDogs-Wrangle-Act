For this project, we will use our data wrangling abilities to extract real-world data from Twitter, clean it, and perform some analysis.

    "\n",
    "2. There are duplicates in image predictions. Drop duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For Twitter_ archives, tweet_id should be a string\n",

    "4. Incorrect datatypes of \"timestamp\", \"rating_numerator\", \"rating_denomerator\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "My tidiness issues were as follows:\n",
    "1. For each stage, a separate column is present. They should be combined to form one.\n",
